<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

<b>Challenge 1: Cafe</b> is a cafe menu. The user receives a pre-loaded list of ingredients and menu items. They are able to add, remove, and edit meals and ingredients as necessary.

<b>Challenge 2: Claims</b> is a work queue for claims processors. The user can add and view claims, or enter the work queue where they will receive claims one by one until all claims in the queue have been processed.

<b>Challenge 3: Badges</b> is a security badge activation program. The user can activate/deactivate a badge as well as grant/revoke access to floors and rooms of the building for existing badges.

<b>Challenge 4: Outings</b> is a record of expenses for company outings. The user can add new outings or edit existing ones. They can also view lists of outings by year or type of outing. The program will indicate if the outings were over/under budget for each year & type of outing.

<b>Challenge 5: Emails</b> is a template generator for marketing emails. The user can view a list of customers and see whether they have had a policy recently, more than 6 months ago, or never, and decide which email template to use based on that info.

<b>Challenge 6: Green Plan</b> is a database for info about customers' vehicles. The user can view data about each vehicle, such as fuel efficiency, mileage, optional add-ons, and whether the vehicle is electric, hybrid, or gas-powered. This data can be used to offer discounts and incentives for current/potential customers.

<b>Challenge 7: Barbecue</b> is a table that shows the expenses for a meal booth and a treat booth at a company BBQ event. The user can input sales data for new BBQ events and view cost breakdowns for all past events.
